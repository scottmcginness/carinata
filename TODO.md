# To do #

Future work, before carinata can even be *considered* stable:
  * Long description of what it does and why
  * Tests (ironic, right?)
  * Benchmark test generation
  * Provide an option to output some useful information
  * Example spec files and their generated output
  * Recommendations (currently scattered, so make a section)
